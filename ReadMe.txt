Grid Embedding based on Multi-task Learning (GEML)
1. Our impletement of the model is based on the code of GrphSAGE through Pytorch 0.4.1 on Python 2.7.
2. The code entry is the GEML_model.py.
3. The shape of input data is a*a*t where a is the dimension of the OD matrix and t is the number of time slots.
